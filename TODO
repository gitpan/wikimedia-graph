* The SVG output currently results in a garbled page (under Opera, not tested
  in other browsers since I was unable to get SVG working in Firefox nor
  Konqueror)
  Allowing the "<svg>" tag in Parser.php seems not to help. Maybe SVG should
  generate a SVG file, and then reference this instead of inlining the SVG
  source code into the page.
